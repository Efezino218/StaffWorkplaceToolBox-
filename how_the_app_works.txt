Purpose of the App ]
The purpose of this app is to allow staff members to easily add and manage their local tools 
(such as files like images, PDFs, and documents) and online tools (such as websites or platforms like Titan, Canva, GPT, etc.). 
By using this app, staff can access all their tools from anywhere, making their work more organized and efficient.
